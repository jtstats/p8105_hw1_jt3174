# Problem 1

#### Create a data frame comprised of:
##### * a random sample size of 8 from a standard Normal distribution
##### * a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
##### * a character vector of length 8
##### * a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r part_1_of_Question_1}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)
# Question: Is this set.seed() here necessary?
# Question: Can I just get any character/factor vector? Or something else is required?
Part1Question1 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(8),
  y = x > 0,
  z = c("rnorm1", "rnorm2", "rnorm3", "rnorm4", "rnorm5", "rnorm6", "rnorm7", "rnorm8"),
  a = factor(c("level1", "level2","level3", "level1", "level2", "level3", "level1", "level2")))

# Is this correct and am I on the right track?
```
